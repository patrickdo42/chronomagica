# Chronomagica — Overview & Developer Instructions

Chronomagica is a Next.js app that presents a welcoming splash screen, then an interactive main view for time, weather, planetary highlights, and basic astronomy-by-location data. The UI already includes inputs, controls, and layout; event logic and data wiring can be layered in using client components.
